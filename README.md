# Java-Tasks-OOP
The course will cover Java fundamentals such as Java Core, collections, multithreading,<br>
OOP, design patterns,basic algorithms and data structures.<br>

<a href="https://github.com/LeeTovetz/Java-Tasks-OOP/tree/main/src/com/task001" >Task 001</a> -> Describe the "Sat" class. Provide it with properties and methods. Create several instances of objects of this class. Use these objects;<br>

<a href="https://github.com/LeeTovetz/Java-Tasks-OOP/tree/main/src/com/task002" >Task 002</a> -> Describe the "Triangle" class. Take the lengths of the sides of the triangle as properties. Implement a method that will return the area of the triangle. Create several objects of this class and test them;<br>

<a href="https://github.com/LeeTovetz/Java-Tasks-OOP/tree/main/src/com/task003" >Task 003</a> -> Describe the Phone class. Also describe the Network class (mobile operator's network). The phone must have a method of registration in the mobile operator's network. Also the phone must have a call method (number of another phone), which will search all the phone numbers registered in the network. If such a number is found, then make a call, if not - display a message that the dialed number is wrong;<br>

<a href="https://github.com/LeeTovetz/Java-Tasks-OOP/tree/main/src/com/task004" >Task 004</a> -> *Create an abstract Shape class that has two abstract methods getPerimetr() and double getArea().<br>
*Create a Point class that has two properties double x double y.<br>
*Create classes that describe at least 3 geometric shapes (they must be subclasses of Shape), and they must contain Point classes as properties.<br>
*Create a board class. The board is divided into 4 parts and each part may contain a shape. The board must have methods that place and remove a piece from the board. There should also be a method that outputs information about all the pieces on the board and their total area.<br>

<a href="https://github.com/LeeTovetz/Java-Tasks-OOP/tree/main/src/com/task005" >Task 005</a> -> *Create a class describing a person (create a method that outputs information about the person).<br>
*Create a class describing a person (create a method that outputs information about the person).<br>
*Create a class for a group - which contains an array of 10 objects of the student class.<br> 
*Implement methods of adding, deleting students and method of finding a student by surname. If you try to add 11 students, create your own exception and handle it.<br> 
*Define the toString() method for the group so that it outputs a list of students in alphabetical order.<br>
